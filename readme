# 10 — 2015

This is my first attempt at an Angular 'app', it uses Spotify's API to list my favourite Albums, Singles and Kanye-related records of the year.

It uses the basics like custom services, $route and a different controllers to let you switch between the different categories. There's quite a bit of repetition in the code, the custom services especially. it was only a quick project so I'd rather try something more ambitious than refractor everything.

### Notes on the lists
- Albums are straightforward, but a word on To Pimp A Butterfly: I can appreciate it but I can't bring myself to love it like I did Good Kid, Maad City. 
- Singles, I disqualified songs that had appeared on the Album list, it was essentially 6 of the same artists.
- Kaney is the best, so he got his own list. He didn't release an album, so the list consists of singles, tracks he produced and the rap perennial 'feat'.
